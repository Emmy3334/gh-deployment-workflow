# GitHub Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

## How it works
- Any change to the `index.html` file on the `main` branch triggers the workflow.
- The workflow deploys the updated site to **GitHub Pages** automatically.
- The site is available at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/`.

## Stretch Goal
In the future, this project can be extended using a static site generator (Hugo, Jekyll, Astro, etc.).
